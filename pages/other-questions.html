    </div>
<h2>Are you at least 17 years old?</h2>
(In some areas, 16-year-olds may donate with parental consent.)

<h2>Have you had a tattoo or piercing in the past 12 months?</h2>
(Depending on local guidelines, this may disqualify you due to potential infections.)

<h2>Do you weigh at least 110 pounds (50 kg)?</h2>
(This ensures that you have enough blood volume to donate safely.)

<h2>Have you had any cold, flu, or other respiratory symptoms in the last 48 hours?</h2>
(This helps protect both the donor and the recipient from possible infections.)

<h2>Are you currently on any medication?</h2>
(Certain medications may disqualify you temporarily or permanently from donating.)

<h2>Have you traveled to a malaria-endemic region in the past year?</h2>
(Travel to certain regions may increase the risk of malaria transmission.)

<h2>Do you have any history of heart disease or stroke?</h2>
(Donors with these conditions may be at a higher risk of complications during or after donation.)

<h2>Have you recently undergone any surgery, or are you planning surgery soon?</h2>
(This is to ensure your body has fully recovered and is in optimal condition.)

<h2>Do you have a history of blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, hepatitis, or syphilis?</h2>
(Donors with these conditions are typically not eligible due to the risk of transmission.)

<h2>Are you pregnant or have you given birth within the last 6 months?</h2>
(Pregnant women and new mothers may be temporarily disqualified to ensure their health and recovery.)

<h2>Have you been drinking alcohol or using recreational drugs recently?</h2>
(These substances can affect your blood and your ability to donate safely.)

<h2>Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, epilepsy, or asthma?</h2>
(Certain conditions may require additional assessment before donating.)

<h2>Have you donated blood in the last 56 days?</h2>
(Blood donation centers typically recommend waiting at least 56 days between whole blood donations.)

<h2>Have you recently experienced significant stress, emotional or physical trauma?</h2>
(Stress can affect the bodyâ€™s ability to recover from blood donation.)

<h2>Do you have any allergies, especially to medications, latex, or blood products?</h2>
(Allergies can impact the donation process and your safety.)
